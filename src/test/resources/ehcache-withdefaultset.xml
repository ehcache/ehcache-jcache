        Sets the path to the directory where cache data and index files are created.

        If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the running VM. Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one

        The following properties are parsed and translated at runtime:
        user.home - User's home directory
        user.dir - User's current working directory
        java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path

        e.g. java.io.tmpdir on Unix would be /tmp
             java.io.tmpdir/application_cache on Unix would be /tmp/application_cache

        Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerEventListener
         and register it with the CacheManager.

        A CacheManagerEventListener listens to for the following CacheManager events:
        - Cache added
        - Cache removed

        The attributes of cacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        (Enable for distributed operation)

        Specifies a CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerProvider, which
        discovers other CacheManagers in the cluster.

         The attributes of cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system with two means of discovery of CacheManager peers
        participating in the cluster:
         - automatic, using a multicast group. This one automatically discovers peers and detects changes such as
           peers entering and leaving the group
         - manual, using manual rmiURL configuration. A hardcoded list of peers is provided at configuration time.

        Configuring Automatic Discovery:
        Automatic discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1, multicastGroupPort=4446"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "automatic"
        - multicastGroupAddress (mandatory) - specify a valid multicast group address
        - multicastGroupPort (mandatory) - specify a dedicated port for the multicast hearbeat traffic

        Configuring Manual Discovery:
        Manual discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                              rmiUrls=//server1:40000/sampleCache1|//server2:40000/sampleCache1|//server1:40000/sampleCache2|//server2:40000/sampleCache2"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "manual"
        - rmiUrls (mandatory) - specify a pipe separated list of rmiUrls, in the form //hostname:port

        The hostname is the hostname of the remote CacheManager peer. The port is the listening port of the RMICacheManagerPeerListener
        of the remote CacheManager peer.

    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                                     properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1, multicastGroupPort=4446, timeToLive=0"/>


    <!--
        (Enable for distributed operation)

        Specifies a CacheManagerPeerListenerFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerListener, which
        listens for messages from cache replicators participating in the cluster.

         The attributes of cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system. The listener component is RMICacheManagerPeerListener
        which is configured using RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory. It is configured as per the following example:

        <cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"
                              properties="hostName=localhost, port=40001, socketTimeoutMillis=2000"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - hostName (optional) - the hostName of the host the listener is running on. Specify where the host is multihomed
        and you want to control the interface over which cluster messages are received.
        - port (mandatory) - the port the listener listens on.
        - socketTimeoutMillis - the number of seconds client sockets will wait when sending messages to this listener
        until they give up. By default this is 120s.

        In this example, hostName has been left blank, as has socketTimeoutMillis. They will default to
            the default NIC IP address and 2000ms respectively.

    <!--Default Cache configuration. These will applied to caches programmatically created through
    the CacheManager.

    The following attributes are required:

    maxElementsInMemory            - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory
    eternal                        - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
                                     element is never expired.
    overflowToDisk                 - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                                     has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes are optional:
    timeToIdleSeconds              - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
                                     i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
                                     Is only used if the element is not eternal.
                                     Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
                                     The default value is 0.
    timeToLiveSeconds              - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
                                     i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
                                     Is only used if the element is not eternal.
                                     Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
                                     The default value is 0.
    diskPersistent                 - Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
                                     The default value is false.
    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds- The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
                                     is 120 seconds.
    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy      - Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
                                     policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
                                     First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
                                     (specified as LFU)
    cacheEventListenerClassNames   - A comma separated list of CacheEventListeners. The fully qualified class name of
                                     the class which implements CacheEventListener is required.
                                     Registered listeners will be notified of cache events such as Element puts, removes and expiries
                                     and Cache status changes. The default if unspecified is an empty notifications list
                                     which does nothing.
